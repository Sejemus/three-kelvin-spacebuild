# Updated Source Code for a new Threekelvin Spacebuild Server
## This is still in development and may be unstable
We just couldn't let it die

Threekelvin Spacebuild is originally made by Ghost400, Randomic and Techbot who stopped development a while ago. Now the sourcecode has been released publicly and we have chosen to bring it back and hopefully turn it into the great gamemode it was meant to be.
